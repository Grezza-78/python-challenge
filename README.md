Bootcamp Module 3 Challenge - Python

This assignment consists of two challenges - PyBank and PyPoll
  
    * PyBank Challenge
      We were asked to create a python script that will analyse the financial records of a company over a five-year period. The data set included dates and                     Profit/Losses incurred by the company over the period which was contained in a CSV file provided.
      
      The output from the script had to produce:
          * The total number of months included in the dataset
          * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
          * The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
          * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
          * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
          * The script had to produce screen output along with a text file output confirming the results
      
      The main.py file contained in my PyBank GitHub produces the information as requested by the challenge including reading the CSV data and then producing the               onscreen outputs that are duplicated in the text file.    

    * PyPoll Challenge
      We were asked to create a python script that will analyse the voting records of a rural US town in an attempt to streamline their vote-counting process. The data         set included VoterID, County and Candidate detail within a CSV file. 
      
      The output from the script had to produce:
          * The total number of votes cast
          * A complete list of candidates who received votes
          * The percentage of votes each candidate won
          * The total number of votes each candidate won
          * The winner of the election based on popular vote
      
      The main.py file contained in my PyPoll GitHub produces the information as requested by the challenge including reading the CSV data and then producing the               onscreen outputs that are duplicated in the text file.
